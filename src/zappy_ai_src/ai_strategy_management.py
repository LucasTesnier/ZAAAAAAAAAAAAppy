    The goal of the AI it's obviously to win the game.
    To achieve it, AI making its own choices divided in 3 big groups of actions called strategy
    We can see 3 different strategies :
        - Survival strategy: Consisting of getting only food to survive.
            The goal of this strategy is to stay alive.
        - Farming strategy : Consisting of getting the most of components in a period P of time,
            making sure the team is always full of players
            The goal of this strategy is to farm and level up as fast as possible
            We can see this strategy in early/mid game (Level 1-6).
        - Aggressive strategy : Consisting of denying the others teams, bumping enemies, intercept enemies call...
            The goal of this strategy is to avoid enemy teams to win the game
            We can see this strategy in very late game (Level 7-8).
